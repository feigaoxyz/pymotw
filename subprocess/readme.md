- `run` function, added in Python 3.5, is a high level API for running a process and optionally collecting its output.
    - `call`, `check_all`, `check_output` are former high-level APIs
- `Popen` is low-level API to build others
- `subprocess` module is intended to replace functions such as `os.system()`, `os.spawnv()` etc.
